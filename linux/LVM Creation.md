# LVM(Logical Volume Creation)

1. Physical Volume (pvcreate, pvdisplay, pvchange, pvmove)
2. Volume group (vgcreate, vgdisplay, vgscan, vgextend, vgreduce, vgexport, vgimport, vgcfgbackup, vgcfgrestore, vgchange, vgremove, vgsync)
3. Logical Volume (lvcreate, lvdisplay, lvremove, lvextend, lvreduce, lvchange, lvsync, lvlnboot)


## Part 1 : Physical Volume (pvcreate, pvdisplay, pvchange, pvmove)
Physical volume is raw disk presented to operating system. It can be local disk, LUN from remote storage, disk from local disk array etc. All storage disks from these types are formatted as physical volumes under LVM so that those can be used in definite file systems.

To check list of disks using below command:
lsblk


### pvcreate
Now that you identified new disk presented to server lets say /dev/rdisk/disk3 for example, you can run pvcreate command to create physical volume out of it.

```
pvcreate /dev/rdisk/disk3
Physical volume "/dev/rdisk/disk3" has been successfully created.
```

### pvdisplay

Now, PV has been created one can see its details with pvdisplay command.
```
pvdisplay /dev/disk/disk3
--- Physical volumes ---
PV Name                     /dev/disk/disk3
VG Name                     
PV Status                   available
Allocatable                 yes
VGDA                        2
Cur LV                      0
PE Size (Mbytes)            32
Total PE                    1557
Free PE                     1557
Allocated PE                0
Stale PE                    0
IO Timeout (Seconds)        default
Autoswitch                  On
Proactive Polling           On
```

Here many fields are self explanatory. Refer LVM legends to have better understanding.  From this output you can also calculate disk size. Total PE x PE size = Disk size (available to use i.e. after formatting space loss)

If you want to drill down PE details i.e. which PE is serving which LV then -v option can be used. This is helpful when disk has bad sectors. Below is output in which PV is part of volume group already.

```
pvdisplay -v /dev/disk/disk3
--- Physical volumes ---
PV Name                     /dev/disk/disk3
VG Name                     /dev/vg01
PV Status                   available
Allocatable                 yes
VGDA                        2
Cur LV                      1
PE Size (Mbytes)            32
Total PE                    1557
Free PE                     0
Allocated PE                1557
Stale PE                    0
IO Timeout (Seconds)        default
Autoswitch                  On
Proactive Polling           On
 
   --- Distribution of physical volume ---
   LV Name                 LE of LV  PE for LV
   /dev/vg01/lvol1         1557      1557
 
   --- Physical extents ---

   00002 current  /dev/vg01/lvol1         00002
   00003 current  /dev/vg01/lvol1         00003
   00004 current  /dev/vg01/lvol1         00004
   00005 current  /dev/vg01/lvol1         00005
   00006 current  /dev/vg01/lvol1         00006
   00007 current  /dev/vg01/lvol1         00007
   00008 current  /dev/vg01/lvol1         00008
   00009 current  /dev/vg01/lvol1         00009
   00010 current  /dev/vg01/lvol1         00010
   00011 current  /dev/vg01/lvol1         00011
   00012 current  /dev/vg01/lvol1         00012

``` 
Here you can see how PV is distributed among different LV. and furthermore it gives you table mapping of PE to LE! There are numerous options can be used with this command but normally -v is used commonly.

### pvchange

pvchange used for changing attributes of physical volume. There are 6 options switch which can be used with this command. Lets see them one by one.

-a

This switch used for availability attribute of PV. This should be accompany with y or n argument. y making PV available and n making it unavailable. You can see example below with n argument which turn PV unavailable which can be verified in pvdisplay output.
~~~/bin/bash 
# pvchange -a n /dev/disk/disk3
Physical volume "/dev/disk/disk3" has been successfully changed.
 
# pvdisplay /dev/disk/disk3
--- Physical volumes ---
PV Name                     /dev/disk/disk3
VG Name                     /dev/vg01
PV Status                   unavailable
Allocatable                 yes
VGDA                        2
Cur LV                      2
PE Size (Mbytes)            8
----- output truncated -----
~~~ 

-S

This switch enables or disables autoswitching. It also has y or n argument. If activated it makes current access path to switch on better available path. If de activated, path switching happens only if current access path goes to un-available state (due to hardware, cable failure). This applies to disks with multi paths only.

-t

Its a timeout value. This switch should be supplied with number of seconds. This value determines if IO timeout happens and problem can be declared for IO on particular PV. Useful in clustering.

```
pvchange -t 90 /dev/disk/disk3
Physical volume "/dev/disk/disk3" has been successfully changed.
```

-x

It enables or disables extensibility of PV. This switch has y and n arguments which enables admin to add/restrict physical extents to PV. Refer LVM legends to have better understanding.

-s

Immediately begin accessing the associated physical volume.

-z

Defines PV is spare or regular. This option has significance in mirroing only.

### pvmove

As name suggests, it used to move data (in LVM term PE) from one PV to another PV. Command essential moves PEs and hence data within from source to destination PV. If destination PV is not specified then all available PVâ€™s in current volume group are considered for move operation. Command decides himself best suited PV for move operation so that allocation policies can be met correctly.

Also if command is supplied with list of PV names then first PV is always considered as source and rest all PVs are considered as destination.

```
pvmove /dev/disk/disk1 /dev/disk/disk2 /dev/disk/disk3
``` 

In above example PEs will be moved from disk 1 to disk2 & disk3.

You can also move data for particular lvol to new PV.
```
pvmove -n /dev/vg01/lvol2 /dev/disk/disk1 /dev/disk/disk2
Transferring logical extents of logical volume "/dev/vg01/lvol2"...
Physical volume "/dev/disk/disk1" has been successfully moved.
Volume Group configuration for /dev/vg01 has been saved in /etc/lvmconf/vg01.conf

lvdisplay -v /dev/vg01/lvol2

----- output clipped -----

   --- Distribution of logical volume ---
   PV Name                 LE on PV  PE on PV
   /dev/disk/disk2         1557      1557

   --- Logical extents ---
   LE    PV1                     PE1   Status 1
   00000 /dev/disk/disk2         00000 current
   00001 /dev/disk/disk2         00001 current
   00002 /dev/disk/disk2         00002 current
   00003 /dev/disk/disk2         00003 current
```

In above example PE belonging to lvol2 will be moved from disk1 to disk2. PE distribution can be confirmed via lvdisplay output.




## Part 2 : Volume group (vgcreate, vgdisplay, vgscan, vgextend, vgreduce, vgexport, vgimport, vgcfgbackup, vgcfgrestore, vgchange, vgremove, vgsync)

### vgcreate

As we all know volume group i.e. VG is a collection if PV. Refer LVM legands for better understanding. VG creation is the next necessary step after PV creation to use disk space in mount points. Since in Unix everything is a file, to manage VG, kernel creates /dev/vgname/group file. This file represents VG in kernel. Let us see how to create VG from bunch of available PV. Post Mar 2008 releases of HPUX creates group file automatically with vgcreate command. But we will see here to how to make one.

First create a directory with desired name of your VG for ex. lets say testvg is our VG name. After that using mknod command create special group file. In command you need to supply major and minor numbers.
Shell
```
mkdir /dev/testvg
mknod /dev/testvg/group c major 0xminor

major number : 64 for version 1.0 VG and 128 for version 2.0 VG
minor number : Its hexadecimal number. 0xnn0000 for v1.0 and 0x0000 for v2.0 where nn/nnn is unique number.
```
Now that special file is generated go ahead to create VG

```
vgcreate /dev/testvg /dev/disk/disk3 /dev/disk/disk4
Volume group "/dev/testvg" has been successfully created.
Volume Group configuration for /dev/testvg has been saved in /etc/lvmconf/testvg.conf
```
 

vgcreate can be run with single PV argument too. This command has several options as below :

    -V 1.0            To decide version.
    -s PE_size    Size of PE to be used in MB. Default is 4MB
    -e max_PE   Max PE per PV. Default is 1016
    -l max_lv      Max number of LV per VG. Default is 255
    -p max_pv   Max number of PV per VG. Default is 255
    -S vg_size    Max future size of VG. Only in v2.0.

 

Above options can be supplied to command with proper values but its not mandatory. If not supplied then their respective values will be taken into consideration while creating VG. Changes in parameters with these options can be seen in vgdisplay output which you can see in coming section.

### vgdisplay

Same as pvdisplay command, vgdisplay is used to view VG details. vgdisplay command can be run with -v option to get more detailed output. If run without -v option then it will show output like below but PV details portion wont be there.
	
``` 
# vgdisplay -v vg_new
--- Volume groups ---
VG Name                     /dev/testvg
VG Write Access             read/write     
VG Status                   available                 
Max LV                      255    
Cur LV                      0      
Open LV                     0      
Max PV                      16     
Cur PV                      2      
Act PV                      2      
Max PE per PV               6000         
VGDA                        2   
PE Size (Mbytes)            32              
Total PE                    26    
Alloc PE                    0       
Free PE                     26    
Total PVG                   0        
Total Spare PVs             0              
Total Spare PVs in use      0 
 
   --- Physical volumes ---
   PV Name                     /dev/disk/disk3
   PV Status                   available                
   Total PE                    10       
   Free PE                     10       
   Autoswitch                  On        
 
   PV Name                     /dev/disk/disk4
   PV Status                   available                
   Total PE                    10       
   Free PE                     10       
   Autoswitch                  On
 ```

In above output, you can see PE Size (Mbytes), Max PE per PV, Max LV, Max PV fields which can be altered with options -s, -e, -l, -p arguments in vgcreate command we seen above.  The above output is pretty self explanatory. It also shows PV details which are part of this VG.

### vgscan

This command used for scanning all available PVs to get information of VG and related LVâ€™s and rebuild /etc/lvmtab file. This command used below options :

    -a Scan all available PV paths.
    -B Write all persistent and legacy paths to /etc/lvmtab file
    -f vg_name Force to update entries of existing VG in /etc/lvmtab with updated info if any
    -k Avoid probing disks. Build file from kernel known structure.
    -N Populate file with persistent DSF names
    -p Preview mode only. It wont update lvmtab file
    -v verbose mode. Prints messages in console.

```
# vgscan -v
/dev/vg00
/dev/disk/disk1_p2
/dev/disk/disk2_p2
```
Scan of Physical Volumes Complete.
 

Normally we use vgscan -v only. After this command you can verify timestamp of /etc/lvmtab file to verify its been updated.

This concludes first 3 commands of VG. In next post we will see how to extend volume group, how to reduce volume group and how to export/import volume group.


## Part 3 : Logical Volume (lvcreate, lvdisplay, lvremove, lvextend, lvreduce, lvchange, lvsync, lvlnboot)
